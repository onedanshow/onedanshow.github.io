            %p Production coordinators want to know that a project is on schedule.  The ReelFX web team and I created numerous internal tools to give them data on a whole project down to individual renders. Select tools that I spearheaded:

            %p Animation supervisors want to give animators great feedback. I created web-based tools to allow a supervisor to cue up an animator's work, watch and seek frame-by-frame, draw annotations, and record it all along side his webcam feedback.
            %ul
              %li Additionally, I've created slideshow tools for quickly flipping through, zooming in/out, and commenting on high resolution artwork.

The state requires each student to complete this training each year and prior years have received much criticism. Our goal was to create entertaining yet informative training, and the user response proved that we were successful.
